Because of how we originally did the computations, the files here are sometimes split in two cases: when 4|N and when 4 does not divide N. They compute for all levels N where the genus of X0(N)* is less than or equal to 5, the rational points, Heegner points, and cusps.

Ranks.log
Computes ranks for minimal levels N, and genus of X0(N)* is less than or equal to 5. Done using ranks.m

The file "minimallevels.m" computes minimal non-exceptional levels less than a certain bound B.
The file " "minimalglessthan5" lists all levels N with genus of X0(N)* is less than or equal to 5.

The file "genus2models.m" creates models for X0(N)* for minimal levels N and genus is 2. The log file is Genus2Models.log.

The file "genus3models.m" creates models for X0(N)* for minimal levels N and genus is 3. The log file is Genus2Models.log

The file "HeegnerPoints4.log" computes Heegner points on X0(N)* for minimal levels N, where 4 | N, and genus is 2, using "SmallLevelsHeegner4.m". The file "HeegnerPointsRemaining.log" has the remaining small levels, computed using "heegnerptssmall.m"

The log files "X0Nstar.log" contain rational points computations using the models listed here and the X0NstarCCsolver.m. These are in folders corresponding to their genus.

The file genus2.m does several genus 2 computations with the built in Chabauty command in magma, using a Mordell--Weil sieve.

The file genus1.log contains the point counts for the genus 1 curves. This was computed with X0Nstarmodelgenus1.m

The files "X0Nstar.m" and "X0Nstar.log" study exceptional points on small levels.

The files "rank0quotients.m" and "ratpts261.m" correspond to the computations for upper bounds on remaining levels discussed in section 8.1.
