This folder contains the following files that compute rational points on exceptional levels.

COMPUTING EXCEPTIONAL LEVELS:

This is done in "exceptional_levels.m" with log file "minimal.log"

MODELS:

The models for N = 200, 216, 224, 225, 396 are computed using the "X0NstarCCsolver.m" code. The log files are in this folder with the names "X0Nstar.log"

The models for N = 40, 48, 72, 80, 88, 96, 100, 108, 112, 120, 135, 144, 147, 162, 196, 240
are in "X0Nstar-models_chatelet.log". These log files were computed with  "makemodelsX0Nstar.m". Note that the Magma intrinsic "X0NQuotient" has a bug in it.

The model for N = 176 is found in Yuji Hasegawa. "Hyperelliptic modular curves $X*_0(N)$." Acta Arithmetica 81.4 (1997): 369-385. <http://eudml.org/doc/207072>. This agrees with the Magma internal for X0NQuotient and therefore with the models in https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05541 They compute rational points on these models in this paper.

The models for 180, 184 are found in Hasegawa, Yuji. “Table of quotient curves of modular curves $X_0 \left( N \right)$ with genus $2$.” (1995). This agrees with the Magma internal for X0NQuotient and therefore with the models in https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05541 They compute rational points on these models in this paper.

RATIONAL POINTS:

The files above for N = 200, 216, 224, 225, 396 also compute rational points.

The rational points computations for N = 40, 48, 72, 80, 88, 96, 100, 108, 112, 120, 135, 144, 147, 162, 196, 240 are in "rationalpoints.m".

The hyperelliptic curves N = 176, 180, 184 and their rational points are done in rationalpointshyperelliptic.m with log file "X0Nstarhyperelliptic.log"

The Heegner points computations are done in "HeegnerPointsExceptionalLevels.log" using "HeegnerExceptional.m" (calling "heegner.m").

The extra points for 147 are partially investigated in the log file "X0147star.log". A plain text file with the minimal polynomials for the exceptional j-invariants is found in "exceptionaljinv.txt". They are the lifts of points on X0(3)* are exhibited by the file "pointsonX03.m"
